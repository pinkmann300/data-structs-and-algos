    The below is an implementation of queues in the Python programming language. Queues are an abstract data type which has the following operations defined on them:
        1) Enqueue (Key a) : Appends the key a to the end of the queue
        2) Dequeue() : Removes the element at the front of the queue. 
        3) Empty? : Returns a boolean value of True if the queue is empty and False otherwise.

    Queues are an example of a FIFO data structure. (First In First Out).
